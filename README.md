# 🌸 Hi, I’m H

I started coding around 5–6 years ago… 💻

Since then, I’ve fallen in love with explaining things in a way that feels  
simple, clear, and beginner-friendly — the way I wish someone explained them to me.

🎓 I studied Computer Science, but most of my real learning came from building things,
breaking things, and helping others understand them without confusion.

### 💡 What I Care About
- Learning in public  
- Clear explanations  
- Helping beginners feel confident  
- Staying consistent and improving every day  

### 🌱 My Motto  
Code. Content. Clarity.  
If I understand something, I explain it — simply.

### 🌙 If you love learning, creating, or just improving a little each day —  
you’ll feel at home here. 🌸
